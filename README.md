# Hive BSQ

Just a quick repo for my solving prototype at hive during bsq.
This is not the final version of the solver but the ideas inside it were good.

The task was to find the largest square in a rectangular map filled with either empty "." or obstacle "o" tiles.
Then draw the largest square in the map with "x"'s. The symbols could be anything for user input but would also have to be valid.
